---

### Improvements

- Better alignment between the README, changelog, package metadata, and current public release state
- Cleaner public provenance hygiene without changing functional source code or policy data
- More consistent packaging maturity metadata by moving the package classifier from Alpha to Beta
- Continued validation of GitHub CI/CD, Security CI/CD, GitHub Pages, package build, and self-check workflows

---

### Notes

- This is a patch release in the 4.0.x line
- No runtime, schema, CLI, control, evaluator, or bundled profile behavior changes are introduced
- The v4.0.3 release remains available as the predecessor release
- This release exists to make the public mirror, package metadata, documentation, and release line consistent before public publication

## OSS Security Policy as Code Starter Kit v4.0.3

This patch release improves public repository hygiene for Azure Pipelines by moving the project pipeline into the supported `pipelines/azure/` layout, reducing unnecessary platform metadata exposure, and aligning detection, documentation, and CLI messaging with that organized structure.

---

### Highlights

- Moved the project Azure Pipelines definition from the repository root into `pipelines/azure/`
- Kept the public Azure YAML free of secrets, tenant identifiers, subscription identifiers, service connection details, internal URLs, private IPs, local paths, and specific machine names
- Updated repository discovery so `evaluate-many --skip-non-repos` recognizes supported nested Azure pipeline layouts
- Improved profile recommendation and terminal wording for Azure pipeline detection
- Normalized synthetic Azure fixture names so examples do not look like real production service connections

---

### Improvements

- Cleaner public repository structure for multi-platform CI evidence
- Better alignment between Azure documentation, parser support, profile recommendation, and batch repository detection
- Lower metadata noise in public fixtures and CI examples
- Added regression coverage for nested Azure pipeline repository detection

---

### Notes

- This is a patch release in the 4.0.x line
- Users running the provided Azure DevOps pipeline should update the pipeline YAML path to `pipelines/azure/azure-pipelines.yml`
- No report schema, bundled profile, control catalog, evaluator scoring, or packaged policy data changes are introduced
- The v4.0.2 tag remains immutable and is not moved
